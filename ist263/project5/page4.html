<h1>Night Life in Barcelona</h1>
<p>It is no secret the Spanish people like to have their fun! Barcelona is definitely the place to go to enjoy the social aspects of their culture and have a good time! The night life is definitely a big part of the culture there and something the country is known for, so it is only fitting to share the best places I found during my time! </p>

<h2>Bara and Rooftops</h2> <br>
<h3>The W Hotel Bar</h3>

<p>The W hotel is located down the beach, right on the water. The shape of it is meant to resemble a sailboat and it lights up at night time, so you can’t miss it. We discovered the bar at the top of the hotel and it quickly became one of our favorite spots to go. It offers the most creative cocktails, a life DJ, amazing sushi, but best of all the view you get of the shoreline. </p>

<h3>Paradiso</h3>

<p>This place is another hidden gem of the city. Overpriced, but worth the visit once just to say you went! No matter the drink you get, there is so much production and imagination that goes into the presentation of it, it is truly one of a kind. </p>

<h3>Iberostar Rooftop</h3>

<p>Me and my friends would go to this rooftop hotel almost every day after class just to sit and look at the views. It’s located in Placa Catalunya, so it was so convenient that it became such a regular spot for us that I felt compelled to include it in here. It’s great for appetizers, mimosas, and relaxing.</p>

<h2>Clubs</h2> <br>

<h3>Opium</h3>

<p>Favorite night club in Barcelona. Located right on the beach, has the best music, and socializing aspect outside where you can mingle and dance. Me and my friend’s all time favorite. </p>

<h3>Sutton</h3>

<h3>Shoko</h3>
<p>Also located right on the waterfront, next to Opium. This club is the most fun on Monday nights and has a great outdoor social patio!</p>

<h3>Razzmatazz</h3>
<p>More of a techno, EDM music club in an old converted warehouse. It has 6 different levels and different themed rooms with various dj's weekly, so you will be sure to never get bored!</p>
