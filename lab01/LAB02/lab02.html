<h1>Carly Feller's Biography</h1>

<p> 
Hi, my name is Carly Feller and I am a senior at Syracuse University where I am studying Information Management and Technology, with a Marketing minor. <strong>I am interested in web development and different facets of digital marketing in the fashion and beauty industry</strong>. This past Summer I had the pleasure of interning at HydraFacial, The Beauty Health Company, in the Growth Marketing department. Here I gained a lot of hands on experience working with, the social media accounts, influencers, brand collaborations, and web development. In addition to this, I am well versed in Python, Sequel and other data base management systems.

   When I am not doing school work, I love to watch movies and tv shows. My go-to TV show is Entourage or New Girl and my all-time favorite movie is Grown Ups. I love all the Harry Potter books and movies, but my newest favorite book is It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover. I love spending time with my family, whether its going on a vacation or just being at home with them playing games and watching movies. My favorite thing to do all together, though, is go skiing on our yearly Winter break ski trip to Colorado. Other than this, I am happiest when around my friends, who never fail to put a smile on my face no matter the occasion. Outside of school, I enjoy:
